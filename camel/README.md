# POC
#### I have created App1,App2 and App3 Spring Boot projects.
1. App1 runs at port 8070 and has 'getProductInfo' endpoint which produces Product JSON.
1. App2 runs at port 8090 and has 'postProductInfo' endpoint which consumes Product JSON.
1. App3 runs at default port and invokes App1 and passes the inputs to App2. Further App2 receives the message and logs the information."# POC"
